# <Horiseon-Refactor>

## Description

For this project, I have refactored messy code for a webpage. I have refactored both the HTML and CSS file. I undertook this task to improve my syntax, organization, and overall understanding of the relation between HTML and CSS. By refactoring, I solved issues such as:
- added semantic HTML elements
- Organized logical HTML elements independant of styling
- Created comprehensive alternative atributes for image elements
- Organized header attributes sequentially
- Created a concise and meaningful title
- Corrected links
- Organized CSS selectors and properties to follow semantic structure
- Added useful commentary within code

## Usage

Feel free to dissect the attached files to se what I did under the hood. You can also find the live webpage at https://ryanh610.github.io/horiseon-refactor/
